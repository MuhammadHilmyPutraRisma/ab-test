# A/B Testing for Game Dataset
Python code for A/B testing on Cookie Cats game data. This project analyzes the impact of moving the first gate from level 30 to level 40 on player retention and game rounds, helping to evaluate if delaying the gate improves player engagement and gameplay experience.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Basic statistical analysis and data visualization
- Outlier detection and removal
- A/B testing for retention and game rounds analysis

## Prerequisites

- Python (v3.10 or higher)
- Library on `python-code.ipynb`
